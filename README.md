I completed the Tata Data Visualization Virtual Experience Program on Forage
Using Tableau, I built a series of dashboards to answer real-world business questions:

📈 CEO Insight: Monthly revenue trends for 2011 to spot seasonality and improve forecasting.

🌍 CMO Insight: Top 10 countries by revenue and quantity to guide market focus.

👥 Customer Insight: Ranking the top 10 customers by revenue to help retain high-value clients.

🛒 Demand Insight: Identifying regions with the greatest product demand to uncover expansion opportunities.

I used Tableau for the visualization.
